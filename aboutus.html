                <h2>Who We Are and How We Got Started.</h2>
                <p>Jess had always dreamed of opening a studio, but had never been able to make that dream a reality.  Then she met Kyle.  
                    He had the same dream so they combined their powers and made it a reality.  
                    Separately their styles are completely different, but that is what makes their partnership so amazing.  
                    When you visit Little Elephant Pottery Studio, you get to see both sides of their story come together in harmony.  
                    Each is able to shine in his and her own light with their work, while bringing something different and unique for you to be inspired by into one place.

                            Needing a release from the hectic and relentless pressures of university, Jess turned to the arts. She tried many different forms before falling in love with pottery.  
                            Here she was finally able to let go and just create.  From handbuilding, to throwing, to glazing, she loves it all.  She even loves the smell of clay.  
                            She has 15 years of experience and loves to tell her tips and tricks to her students.  
                            Specializing in handbuilding, where she builds whatever her mind and hands can imagine, she brings a passion and expertise to everything she does.
